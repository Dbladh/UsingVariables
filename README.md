The second project for iOS pre-course using variables.

### Step 1: Get the project started on your computer and on GitHub

- Or fork this project and clone it to your computer

### Step 2: Add a BMI calculator
- Remember that we're working in the AppDelegate file in the "didFinishLaunchingWithOptions" fuction
- Declare two variables (height and weight with the type CGFloat)
- Store values in each of them (height = 71.0 and weight = 185.0)
- Declare a new varriable (bodyMassIndex with the type CGFloat)
- And set it to (weight / (height * height)) * 703
- Log the weight to the console
