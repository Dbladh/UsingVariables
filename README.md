UsingVariables
==============

The second project for iOS pre-course using variables.

### Step 1: Get the project started on your computer and on GitHub
- *For more detailed instructions see the first [project](https://github.com/DevMountain/AGoodStart.git)*
- *'**Step 1**' is something we will do hundreds of times in class. You need to be able to do it quickly and without running into issues so it doesn't slow class down.*
- Either create a project locally and push to GitHub
- Or fork this project and clone it to your computer


### Step 2: Add a BMI calculator
- Remember that we're working in the AppDelegate file in the "didFinishLaunchingWithOptions" fuction
- Declare two variables (height and weight with the type CGFloat)
- Store values in each of them (height = 71.0 and weight = 185.0)
- Declare a new varriable (bodyMassIndex with the type CGFloat)
- And set it to (weight / (height * height)) * 703
- Log the weight to the console
